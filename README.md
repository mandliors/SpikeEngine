# Spike Engine

Spike engine is a 2D game framework which provides you with a lot of features.

## Main features:
- A fast and convenient 2D rendering API
- A professional 2D physics engine (Box2D)
- A really fast entity component system (EnTT)
- An excellent GUI library for debugging (ImGui)
- Easy input handling (and event management)
- Great debugging and benchmarking tools
- An easy-to-use audio system

## Plans
- I plan to turn this framework into a really easy to use game engine
- Support multiple platforms (Web, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS)
- Maybe in the future I will also implement 3D rendering
