# Spike_Engine

Spike engine is a 2D game engine (a framework yet) which provides you with a lot of features.




# Main features:
-A fast and easy to use 2D rendering API
-A professional 2D physics engine (Box2D)
-A really fast entity component system (EnTT)
-An excellent GUI library (ImGui)
-Easy input handling (and event management)
-Great debugging and benchmarking tools




# Plans
-I plan to turn this framework into a really easy to use game engine
-Support multiple platforms (Web, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS)
-Maybe in the future I will also implement 3D rendering support
